# Workshop 2: UI/UX Design

Congratulations on taking the first step towards developing a great user experience for your app! Designing your user interface (UI) and figuring out your user's experience (UX) before you start coding will save you a lot of time in the long run. 

The interactive portion of this workshop will focus on learning how to use Figma and building a first project wireframe. With practice, you will be making expert-looking project prototypes in no time!

## Homework

* Create a free Figma account [here](https://www.figma.com/)


## Getting Started

1. Click "Workshop 2 Starter.fig" in this folder, then "Download" in its page
2. Save to an easily-accessible location
3. In Figma now: On the main page where your files go, there should be a button in the top-right that looks like an arrow pointing in a box. Click this to import a file into Figma
4. Select your newly-downloaded file
5. Follow along with the workshop to learn how to use Figma!


## After the Workshop

Well done finishing the workshop! You now have the necessary skills to create your own project design mockups using Figma! Moving forward, we would recommend the follow steps to continue developing and learning:

To continue learning, we’d highly recommend you


*   Continue working on your paper and computer-based prototypes and constantly iterate them in response to user feedback
*   Check out other learning resources available at the Oasis Starting Guide [here](https://github.com/northeastern-oasis/Ultimate-Oasis-Starting-Guide/tree/master/ui-ux-design)


## If you couldn't make the workshop

If you were not able to attend, don't worry! You can still learn how to use Figma. We would still recommend trying to work your way through the starter file. It includes instructions for what to do to get you acclimated to the Figma tools and creating an interactive mockup!
