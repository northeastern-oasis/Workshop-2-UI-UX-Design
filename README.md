# Workshop 2: UI/UX Design

Congratulations on taking the first step towards developing a great user experience for your app! Designing your user interface (UI) and figuring out your user's experience (UX) before you start coding will save you a lot of time in the long run. 

The interactive portion of this workshop will focus on learning how to use Figma and building a first project wireframe. With practice, you will be making expert-looking project prototypes in no time!
